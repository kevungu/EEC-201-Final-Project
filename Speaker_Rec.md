# EEC-201-Final-Project
To initialize Speaker_Rec all files must be downloaded and placed in MATLAB's file path.
Speaker_Rec.mlapp should only be downloaded once as latter downloads don't work such as Speaker_Rec.mlapp(1), Speaker_Rec.mlapp(2), and beyond.
Once the GUI has opened, type in the ID of the test speaker under the input file and press button directly underneath. The output will determine the corresponding speaker ID from the training data.
When pressing any button, do so only once of the program will slow down or the sound file will play multiple times with overlap.
